My passion for statistics and its potential to solve real-world problems has driven me through a fulfilling career in the Indonesian civil service, specializing in statistical analysis and data management. This experience, coupled with my academic background in statistics and data science, has solidified my desire to pursue a PhD in statistics. I believe that further academic exploration will equip me with the advanced knowledge and research skills necessary to make significant contributions to the field of statistics and its applications in public policy and development.
Since 2014, I have served as a Statistician at the Geospatial Information Agency of The Republic of Indonesia. In this role, I have honed my expertise in various statistical methodologies, including data collection, analysis, and interpretation. My key contributions include:
•	Leading the implementation of a new statistical framework for Integration Spatial Statistics of Thematic Geospasial Information, which resulted in higher utilization for public needs.
•	Providing statistical analysis and insights for Internal Assessment Team of the Sectoral Statistics Development Index, which used for measure of the achievement of Bureacratic Reform.
•	Collaborating with cross-functional teams to develop and implement data-driven solutions for basic mapping of Indonesia using machine learning, leading to faster mapping.
These experiences have instilled in me a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with using statistics in a government setting. I have witnessed firsthand the power of data to inform policy decisions, improve public services, and drive positive change. However, I also recognize the need for further research and innovation to address complex statistical problems and develop new analytical techniques relevant to the Indonesian context.
My academic foundation in statistics and data science provides a strong platform for pursuing doctoral studies. I earned my Master Degree in Statistics and Data Science from IPB University in 2023, where I excelled in courses such as Data Science, Statistical Analysis of Spatial Data, Statistical Data Management, Statistical Machine Learning, and Statistical Programming. My master thesis research project on Mapping Flood Location using machine learning on satellite imagery data  further solidified my interest in Statistical Machine Learning and its applications in Spatial Data.
My decision to pursue a PhD stems from a desire to:
•	Deepen my knowledge and understanding of advanced statistical theory and methods.
•	Develop the skills to conduct independent research and contribute to the advancement of the field.
•	Focus on Statistical Machine Learning, which has significant implications for geospatial mapping in Indonesia.
•	Return to the Indonesian civil service with the expertise and research skills necessary to make even greater contributions to evidence-based policymaking and development.
I believe that my background in both civil service and statistics positions me well to address this issue from both theoretical and practical perspectives.
I am particularly drawn to your Statistics PhD program at King Abdulaziz University because of it is the top-ranked universities in the Saudi Arabia with a strong reputation for research and innovation with has many distinguished faculty with international publications and collaborations. I am confident that the program's rigorous curriculum, distinguished faculty, and collaborative research environment will provide me with the ideal setting to pursue my research goals and develop as a scholar.

I am confident that my dedication to statistics, my proven track record in the civil service, and my strong academic background make me a strong candidate for your PhD program. I am eager to contribute to the vibrant research community at King Abdulaziz University and to make a meaningful impact on the field of statistics in Indonesia and beyond.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.

Sincerely,


Abdul Aziz Nurussadad
